# QMC

## Var & CVaR calculations by QMC

### Objectives: 
- Implementation of low-discrepancy sequences
- Implementation of sampling methods
- Implementation of stochastic algorithms converging to VaR/CVaR
- Test algorithm for different probability laws
- Add imporance sampling procedure and adaptive confidence level

### Results:
- Variance reduction when using quasi-random numbers vs pseudo-random numbers
