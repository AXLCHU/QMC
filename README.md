# QMC

## Var & CVaR calculations by QMC

### Objectives: 
- Implementation of low-discrepancy sequences
- Implementation of different sampling methods
- Implementation of stochastic algorithms converging to VaR/CVaR
- Test algorithm for different probability laws
- Add Imporance Sampling procedure and adaptive confidence level

### Results:
- Better coverage for QRNG vs PRNG
- Variance reduction when using QRNG vs PRNG - depends on the sampling method
- Variance reduction when adding Importance Sampling procedure
